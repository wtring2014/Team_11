So far I have contributed by creating the database for Inventory and User info, and importing the data.
I have helped with the Balsalmiq models
Submitted input to the documentations
Created the Products.php and Search.php pages

For the next assignment, my goal is to implement the shopping cart feature which would allow a user to add products
  to the shopping cart from both the product and search pages. This also includes reserving rentals through the checkout page.


I think our team needs to:
  implement a user profile page, 
   registration page (admin or student selection), 
   and import product pictures to the database.
